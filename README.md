## Leftovers/to be completed
1. Adding Lombok annotations support (IDE does not recognize it).
2. Fix and complete the queries for the second endpoint ("findAllByHospitalId");
3. Didn't manage to test it.
4. If we're talking about production-ready aaplication- 
  * input-validation for the endpoints.
  * user authentication and autorization.
  * depends on scalability- using noSql DB (and not Postgres, which is RDBMS)
